        <h4>Ingridients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Mackerel fillets (skin-on)</li>
            <li>Sake</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Sudachi (optional)</li>
            <li>Grated daikon (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Take your mackerel fillets and wash them with cold running water. Next, place them in a sealable container and rub a small amount of sake over the top. Seal with a lid and rest in the fridge for 15 minutes, 30 minutes if you have time.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Before grilling fish, it is important to ensure the oven grill is well-preheated. 3-5 minutes on a medium-high to high heat setting is usually about enough time, although this can depend on your grill, and electric grills generally take longer. Be sure to thoroughly preheat before placing your fish under the heat source.</li>
            <br>
            <li>While the grill is preheating, pat the mackerel dry with kitchen paper on both sides.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Sprinkle both sides with a generous pinch of salt. Sprinkling the salt from a height will help evenly distribute it over the surface and stop the salt clumping together in one place.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Make 3 to 4 shallow, diagonal cuts on the skin side of the mackerel, being careful not to cut too deep.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place the mackerel fillets on the grill with the skin side down and cook for 4 minutes. You might need to increase the time by a few minutes depending on the strength of your oven grill and the thickness of your fillets.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Flip the mackerel fillets over and grill the skin side for 3 minutes or until lightly charred and crispy.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Once done, place on serving plates and serve as you like! I recommend serving with a slice of sudachi (or citrus of your choice) for squeezing and grated daikon drizzled with a touch of soy sauce for a refreshing kick!</li>
        </ol>

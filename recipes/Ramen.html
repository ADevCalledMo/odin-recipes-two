          <h4>Steps:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a large pot of water to
              boiling on high. Finely chop the stems of the choy sum into small
              pieces, then roughly chop the leaves into large bite-sized pieces.
              Peel and mince the garlic and ginger. Thinly slice the scallions,
              separating the white bottoms and green tops. Cut off and discard
              the root end of the enoki mushrooms.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Season the flank steak with salt and pepper on both sides. In a
              medium pot, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium until hot.
              Cook the steak 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until it reaches your
              desired degree of doneness. (Loosely cover the pot with aluminum
              foil to help the steak cook faster.) Transfer the steak to a
              plate, leaving any drippings in the pot. Let the steak rest for at
              least 5 minutes, loosely covering the plate with aluminum foil to
              keep warm.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              To the pot with the steak drippings, add 2 teaspoons of olive oil
              and heat on medium until hot. Add the garlic, ginger and white
              parts of the scallions, and cook 1 to 2 minutes, or until fragrant
              and slightly softened, stirring frequently. Add the choy sum and
              season with salt and pepper. Cook 1 to 3 minutes, or until the
              choy sum is slightly softened and wilted.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Increase the heat to high. Stir in the enoki mushrooms, beef
              demi-glace, miso paste, soy sauce and 4 cups of water. Bring the
              soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer 4 to 5
              minutes to develop the flavors.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              While the soup is boiling, find the lines of muscle (or the grain)
              of the cooked flank steak and thinly slice the beef against
              (perpendicular to) the grain. Add any steak juices from the
              cutting board into the soup. Transfer the sliced steak to a small
              bowl and toss with the hoisin sauce until well coated.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              To the large pot of boiling water, add the fresh ramen noodles and
              cook 1 to 2 minutes, or until the noodles are tender, stirring
              frequently to prevent sticking. Drain the noodles thoroughly. Stir
              the cooked noodles into the soup and remove from heat. To plate
              your dish, divide the soup and noodles between 2 bowls and lay the
              coated flank steak on top. Garnish with the green parts of the
              scallions. Enjoy!
